I am leaving Prof. Pawliszyn's research group for Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai(ISMMS) in September. During the past two week, I made 171 slides for a workshop about metabolomics data analsysis for our group in University of Waterloo. One target is training new group member and another target is to set up a reproducible data analysis system to facilitate further data analysis. 

I divided this workshop into five different parts: the first part is about a general introduction about metabolomics; the second part is related to statistical analysis in metabolomics; the third part is focused on batch effects; the fourth part is annotation and the last part is a demo for the whole workflow. I made the presentation in five days and lasted for about 7 hours in total. Now I realized the presentation was a physical labor when you had to talk and answer questions in more than one hour at dinner-time.

As I promised, here is the slides for the workshop:

- [Introduction](http://yufree.github.io/presentation/metabolomics/introduction#1)

- [Statistical Analysis](http://yufree.github.io/presentation/metabolomics/StatisticalAnalysis#1)

- [Batch Correction](http://yufree.github.io/presentation/metabolomics/BatchCorrection#1)

- [Annotation](http://yufree.github.io/presentation/metabolomics/Annotation#1)

- [Demo](http://yufree.github.io/presentation/metabolomics/demo#1)

Those slides are wroten by [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), which means they support full screen (press f) and notes (press p). The source file could be found [here](https://github.com/yufree/presentation) under subfolder 'metabolomics'. You might find amusing images or GIF at the beginning of each slides and I found such way could really help to relax both the reporter and the audiences (I stole this idea and some GIF from [Yihui](https://yihui.name/en/2017/05/gifs/)).

Since it's already public availiable, you could also use them as your wishes. No Guarantee. I will appreciate if you could send some feedbacks or enhencements for those slides. Those slides would be updated with [Meta-Workflow](https://yufree.cn/metaworkflow/) which you could also comment on the source [file](https://github.com/yufree/metaworkflow).

Enjoy your Friday 13rd!
